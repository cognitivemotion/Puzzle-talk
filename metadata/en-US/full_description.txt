Escapepod is a podcast player with a minimalistic approach, that may not be to everyone's liking. The app has only a single screen. Playback controls and a list of podcasts that shows the five most recent episodes each. Escapepod has no podcast discovery feature. It only offers a very simple search option and it opens RSS podcasts links when you tap them in a web browser.
